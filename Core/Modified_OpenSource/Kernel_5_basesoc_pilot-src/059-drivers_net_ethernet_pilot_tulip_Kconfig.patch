+	help
+	  NAPI is a new driver API designed to reduce CPU and interrupt load
+	  when the driver is receiving lots of packets from the card. It is
+	  still somewhat experimental and thus not yet enabled by default.
+
+	  If your estimated Rx load is 10kpps or more, or if the card will be
+	  deployed on potentially unfriendly networks (e.g. in a firewall),
+	  then say Y here.
+
+	  See <file:Documentation/networking/NAPI_HOWTO.txt> for more
+	  information.
+
+	  If in doubt, say N.
+
+config TULIP_NAPI_HW_MITIGATION
+	bool "Use Interrupt Mitigation "
+	depends on TULIP_NAPI
+	---help---
+	  Use HW to reduce RX interrupts. Not strict necessary since NAPI reduces
+	  RX interrupts but itself. Although this reduces RX interrupts even at
+	  low levels traffic at the cost of a small latency.
+
+	  If in doubt, say Y.
+
+config PILOT_SG
+	depends on MACH_PILOT4_ASIC
+	bool "Enable SG support"
+	help
+	  Enable NIC Scatter/gather support and inform the Linux stack
