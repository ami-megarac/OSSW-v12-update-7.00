This module supports the PCA954x series of I2C multiplexer/switch chips
made by Philips Semiconductors.
This includes the:
 	 PCA9540, PCA9542, PCA9543, PCA9544, PCA9545, PCA9546, PCA9547
 	 and PCA9548.
 
These chips are all controlled via the I2C bus itself, and all have a
single 8-bit register. The upstream "parent" bus fans out to two,
four, or eight downstream busses or channels; which of these
are selected is determined by the chip type and register contents. A
mux can select only one sub-bus at a time; a switch can select any
combination simultaneously.
